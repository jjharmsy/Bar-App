This repo will be for the development of a bar app. There are infinite directions that this could go but to start off here are some base hopes/ideas for base functionality

## Base Ideas & Proposed Functionality

**NOTE:** All names/ideas here are completely arbitrary, they don't have to be named that and we don't have to implement them if we don't want to.

+ Login/Account services
    + Tiered accounts to generate revenue?
    + Types of Accounts: DJ/Band, Bartender/Owner, General Public
+ Interactive map (similar to snapchat, better than google maps or apple maps)
    + Ability to view venues/bars in your area and display certain stats as "*tags*" or *values*.
        + `sardine-scale`: Amount of current attendees/how packed is it.
        + `music`: **type of music playing** (*live band?, DJ, performer*), **what genre** (*hiphop, rap, edm, country, rock, etc*). 
        + `age-range`: avg age of people in attendance
        + `rage-gauge`: how intoxicated are people or how crazy is it.
        + `publicRating` vs `NiteLifeRating`: overall rating system for each bar, possible app generated rating system that takes into account a person's personal likes (*what we think you may like*)
        + `drink-deals`: section for promotions or drink deals ("*#lationight!, #bogoirishcarbombs!, etc*")
    + Each bar/venue will have a `promoter` or `performer` account linked to it for who is performing at that time.
        + they can have an individual rating system as well
    + possible pictures or review section where users can leave a review

## Proposed Support Technologies

+ **[ReactNative](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)**: The frontend, [javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) based app building platform. 
+ **[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/code/#javascript)**: The API platform @bcain150 proposes we use. This is new and up-and-coming, a more simple way to handle making [API requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/#api-requests-defined).
+ **TODO**: Backend?
+ **TODO**: Necessary Cloud Services?

## Development Process
+ Use VSCode to branch, make Pull Requests via GitHub repo.
+ **TODO**: *in the future add more here such as: dependencies, recommended vscode plugins, unit testing framework, CI/CD, etc?*
